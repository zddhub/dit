> Helping you practise a new programming language

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

It is difficult to master a language by practicing small examples from document page, systematic practise is needed. 

We hope to provide a good project, Dit - the simple content tracker as Git does, to get you off the ground and master a new programming language as quickly as possible.


## Origin

* From the love of Git and worship of Linus.
* "Do it together", hope more guys participate in.
* Learn more about Git.
* More practice when come to learning a new programming language.

## Examples

- [Golang](golang)
